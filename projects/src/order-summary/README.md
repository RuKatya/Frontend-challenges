## Overview

This project is my first experiment with a similar task. I tried to create a component as close as possible to the design.
To create the component, I decided to use HTML tags, and SCSS.

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out the order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Your users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements
